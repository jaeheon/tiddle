rd 1 x
wr 2 x


Explanation.
A file, named "Example.java", will be generated in the same directory.
The input trace is repeated verbatim at the top of the file.
In the input trace listed above, thread 1 reads shared variable x, then
thread 2 writes to x. Your analysis tool should ignore the CyclicBarrier
cb and cc in order to not capture the happens-before effects of this
artificially introduced synchronization.

The java program's package name is hard-coded in Main.hs.

Alex and happy need to be run just once after you make changes to 
Lexer.x and Parser.y.
